# LevelUp!

LevelUp! is the all-in-one community builder written in Rust. With LevelUp!, you can foster your community without any restriction in terms of central authority and technical limitation. The network of LevelUp! is built on top of Polkadot protocol's Substrate framework for Web3 use cases and supports Activity Pub for Fedverse use cases.

LevelUp! is still in development and MVP progress will be announced soon.
